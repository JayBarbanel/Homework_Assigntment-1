# Homework_Assigntment-1
The purpose of this assisgnment was to refactor the existing code. 
Refeacoting is useful to to implement new technology so that the code is more clear. 
The website title was the first thing I fixed as origonally it did not have the companies name in the title.
This included adding a 'header' section.  Changing the divs to 'sections' and updating the footer.  
With that, in the ccs style file, it was important to remove the '.' when you were not using a class.  
I also needed to add a # to css when using the ids.  
It is important to incluide  alt text to images as well, which were missing in this origional code and later added.
