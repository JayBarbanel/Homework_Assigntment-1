# UCLA_HomeworkAssignment1_CodeRefractor
The purpose of this assisgnment was to refactor the existing code. 
Refractoring is useful to implement new technology so that the code is more clear. 

# Changes Made:
The website title was the first thing I fixed as origonally it did not have the companies name in the title.
This included adding a 'header' section.  
Changing the divs to 'sections' and updating the footer.  
With that, in the ccs style sheet, it was important to remove the '.' when you were not using a class.  
I also needed to add a # to css when using the ids.  
It is important to incluide  alt text to images as well, which were missing in this origional code and later added.  
WHen clicking on Search Engine Optimization, it also did not function the way it should.  The other nav bar objects bring you to their respective sections when clicked, so I had to go in and link Search Engine Optimization.
